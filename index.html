        <p class="text-muted text-left" >Jan Schiff Elementary is named after a beloved citizen of Fort Bend County. Jan Schiff spent her adult life working with public schools. She was the Volunteers in Public Schools Coordinator for Fort Bend ISD before her untimely passing on January 5, 2008. Through her work, Jan felt passionately about education and changing the world, one person at a time.
 
Jan served in many capacities in the community including her children's PTOs throughout their school careers, Fort Bend Chapters of the American Cancer Society, CASA, as well as several boards including the Fort Bend Literacy Council, and Fort Bend A.W.A.R.E. (a branch of the Houston Alzheimer's Association). She was most proud of her service for many years on the Fort Bend Education Foundation Board. Her greatest joy was her family.

We are proud to continue Jan Schiff's legacy in making a great education possible for every child!

MISSOURI CITY, TX – Cindy Cormier, a fifth-grade teacher Jan Schiff Elementary School, has been named the Fort Bend ISD’s Elementary Teacher of the Year.

Cormier, who has taught for 16 years, joined Schiff Elementary when the school opened in 2008.  While at Schiff, she has taught all subjects at the fifth-grade level with an emphasis on the individual growth of each of her students.

“Ms. Cormier does more than simply educate, she teaches ‘life,’” says Schiff Elementary Principal Mary Brewster.  “Her students truly have a special bond with her.”

Cormier received her Bachelor of Arts degree in Urban Studies from Jackson State University and her Master of Education in Elementary Education from the University of St. Thomas.  She is currently pursuing her Doctorate in Urban Education from Texas A&M University.

She also was recognized last year as a finalist for the statewide H-E-B Excellence in Education Awards.

The morning after accepting the District’s award for Elementary Teacher of the Year, Cormier was swamped by her students and fellow teachers in a special classroom celebration.

"It’s a very special moment for all of us at the school,” adds Brewster.

Jan Schiff Elementary, part of the Fort Bend Independent School District, is a Texas Education Agency “Recognized” campus.</p>
